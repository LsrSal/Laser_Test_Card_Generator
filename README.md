# Laser_Test_Card_Generator
Test card generator, primarily as stop-gap for LaserGRBL where this functionality as of today is missing and desperately needed.

Written in pure HTML+JS.
No installation needed, just run it or drop on your favorite browsers.
Click on the card to save "nc"file.

I'm no software developer, so do not judge my code harshly. It works well enough, IMHO, where I believe it can be useful to others, especially users of LaserGRBL.
